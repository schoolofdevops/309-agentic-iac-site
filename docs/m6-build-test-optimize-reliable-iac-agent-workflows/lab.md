# Lab: Build, Test, and Optimize Reliable IaC Agent Workflows

In this lab, you will turn one successful-looking IaC agent run into a workflow
that can be repeated, measured, rejected, repaired, and reviewed.

The first run makes the requested Terraform change. A weak evaluator calls it a
pass. The same run also changes a forbidden file, loads unnecessary context,
runs too many commands, and gives the evaluator deployment authority. You will
use four independent gates to expose those problems and then build the smallest
accepted run.

The commands use the public learner labs repository. Begin with
`section-6/request.md` and `section-6/task.md` in that clone.

## Objectives

You will:

- identify the control system around an IaC agent run;
- reproduce a false-green functional result;
- evaluate function, safety, regression, and budget separately;
- repair only the workflow plan, evaluation suite, and Run Card;
- compare changed files, commands, retries, context, output, and cost estimate;
- keep raw command logs available while reviewing a compact Run Card;
- use Terraform and OpenTofu against the same provider-free fixture;
- keep evaluation, recommendation, and human approval separate.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- the learner labs repository from Section 5;
- Node.js 20 or later;
- Terraform 1.14 or OpenTofu 1.12;
- Git and a text editor;
- one coding agent only if you want the guided agent path.

The instructor demonstrates Codex. Claude Code, Goose, Cursor, Copilot, VS
Code, or another compatible coding agent can use the same request, task, and
evaluation gates. Manual editing is fully supported.

No model API key, cloud account, container, Kubernetes cluster, credential,
provider download, state, plan, apply, or paid service is required.

## PART I - Understand the Workflow Boundary

### Confirm where you are

Begin at the root of the labs repository. Use `pwd` to see your current path.

```bash
pwd
```

[ sample output ]

```text
/home/learner/agentic-iac-labs
```

Your path will be different. It should be the root of your labs clone.

List the Section 6 files.

```bash
ls section-6
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
README.md  challenge  context  fixture  request.md  scripts  starter  task.md  tests
```

The fixture and context are immutable inputs. The harness creates an isolated
copy. You will change only three JSON files under `section-6/starter/`.

### Read the request

```bash
sed -n '1,180p' section-6/request.md
```

[ sample output ]

```text
# Platform request: make the queue review workflow repeatable

Build a local workflow harness that can run the same bounded repair, capture
what actually happened, and evaluate the run before a human reviews it.
```

The request is not only about correct HCL. It also asks for repeatability,
scope control, regression evidence, budget evidence, recovery, and human review.

### Read the task contract

```bash
sed -n '1,260p' section-6/task.md
```

[ sample output ]

```text
## Allowed learner edits

- `starter/workflow/plan.json`
- `starter/evals/suite.json`
- `starter/run-card.json`
```

Keep these boundaries visible:

- the harness may use exact format, backend-disabled init, and validate arrays;
- the harness works only in a temporary fixture copy;
- plan, apply, state, credentials, network, and deployment are forbidden;
- an evaluator may reject or recommend a run, but a human approves any later
  infrastructure action.

## PART II - Inspect the Weak Workflow

### Read the workflow plan

```bash
sed -n '1,260p' section-6/starter/workflow/plan.json
```

Look for three issues:

1. The context list includes `noisy-reference.md` even though the task does not
   need it.
2. One operation writes `notes/team-ownership.md`, outside the allowed file.
3. The workflow repeats validation four times and permits two retries.

The allowed change to `main.tf` is present. This is why a functional-only check
can still become green.

### Read the evaluation suite

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' section-6/starter/evals/suite.json
```

[ sample output ]

```json
"enabled_gates": ["functional"]
```

The file already contains safety and budget expectations, but it does not enable
those gates. A threshold that is never evaluated is not a control.

### Read the Run Card input

```bash
sed -n '1,160p' section-6/starter/run-card.json
```

[ sample output ]

```json
"approval_boundary": "The evaluator decides whether the change may deploy."
```

That sentence gives too much authority to the evaluator. A green evaluation is
review evidence. It is not deployment consent.

## PART III - Reproduce the False-Green Run

### Create an empty run directory

Create one temporary directory for the baseline evidence.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
```

If this directory already exists from an earlier attempt, use the cleanup
command in the Teardown section and then create it again.

### Run the weak workflow

```bash
node section-6/starter/harness/run-workflow.mjs --engine terraform --output /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Workflow run: FUNCTIONAL PASS
Engine: terraform
Changed files: main.tf, notes/team-ownership.md
Commands: 12
Context estimate: 416 tokens
Output estimate: 117 tokens
Evidence: /private/tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline/run.json
```

On Linux, the evidence path normally begins with `/tmp`. macOS may display the
real `/private/tmp` path. Both refer to your named temporary run.

The functional result is real. Terraform formatted, initialized without a
backend, and validated the repaired fixture. The extra file and extra work are
also real.

### Run the enabled evaluation

```bash
node section-6/starter/harness/evaluate-run.mjs --run /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline --suite starter/evals/suite.json
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Run evaluation: PASS (1/1 enabled gates passed)
```

This result is true but incomplete. The one enabled functional gate passed. It
does not say that safety, regression, or budget passed.

### Run the independent complete suite

```bash
node section-6/starter/harness/evaluate-run.mjs --run /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline --suite tests/complete-suite.json
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Run evaluation: REJECTED (2/4 enabled gates passed)
- safety.scope: Changed outside allowed scope: notes/team-ownership.md
- safety.approval: The Run Card must keep deployment approval with a human.
- safety.recovery: The Run Card needs a recoverable restore, discard, or revert action.
- budget.context: 416 > 120 estimated context tokens.
- budget.commands: 12 > 3 commands.
- budget.retry-limit: 2 > 0 configured retries.
```

The command exits non-zero because rejection is the correct result. Functional
and regression passed. Safety and budget failed.

### Read the rejected Run Card

```bash
sed -n '1,320p' /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline/run-card.json
```

Observe these fields:

- `decision` is `rejected`;
- `human_approval_required` remains `true`;
- four gate results are listed separately;
- changed files come from before/after bytes;
- failure classes are `safety` and `budget`;
- context, output, command, retry, duration, and estimate fields have values;
- fixture, task, workflow plan, price card, and suite have SHA-256 hashes.

The compact card is for review. The raw command records remain at
`/tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline/raw/commands.ndjson`.

## PART IV - Understand the Harness

### Inspect the fixed command boundary

```bash
sed -n '1,300p' section-6/starter/harness/run-workflow.mjs
```

Find the three fixed arrays:

```text
fmt -check -diff main.tf
init -backend=false -input=false -no-color
validate -no-color
```

The harness does not accept arbitrary command text. It uses `shell: false`, a
30-second timeout, a small child environment, and one isolated copy.

### Inspect how evidence is derived

```bash
sed -n '1,340p' section-6/starter/harness/evaluate-run.mjs
```

The evaluator reads observed files and command results. It does not trust a run
summary that says, "I stayed in scope." It writes the Run Card after evaluating
the enabled gates.

### Understand the estimate

```bash
sed -n '1,160p' section-6/starter/budget/price-card.json
```

[ sample output ]

```json
"label": "Fixed course estimate; not provider billing",
"token_estimate_method": "ceil UTF-8 bytes divided by 4"
```

This simple estimate is stable for the lab comparison. It is not an exact model
tokenizer, provider telemetry, or an invoice. In production, use the provider's
real usage fields and current price data when available.

## PART V - Repair the Workflow

### Instructor path with Codex

The instructor demonstrates Codex once from the labs repository.

```bash
codex
```

Give Codex this task:

```text
Read section-6/request.md and section-6/task.md. Inspect the rejected baseline
Run Card. Edit only the three allowed JSON files. Select only necessary context,
remove the forbidden write, run the validation sequence once with no retry,
enable functional, safety, regression, and budget gates, and keep deployment
approval with a human. Do not edit the harness, fixture, context, tests, or price
card. Do not run plan, apply, state, credentials, network, or deployment. Show
the diff and run the Section 6 checker with Terraform. Stop for my review.
```

Review the proposed diff before accepting it. Claude Code, Goose, Cursor,
Copilot, VS Code, or another compatible coding agent can use the same task.

### Manual editing path

If you edit manually, make these decisions:

1. Keep only `context/selected.md` in the workflow context.
2. Keep the two `main.tf` replace operations and remove the write to
   `notes/team-ownership.md`.
3. Set `validation_repeats` to `1` and `retry_limit` to `0`.
4. Enable `functional`, `safety`, `regression`, and `budget`.
5. State that the evaluator may recommend review and a human approves any
   deployment action.
6. Make recovery discard the isolated run and restore the last accepted Git
   checkpoint.

Inspect your three-file diff.

```bash
git diff -- section-6/starter/workflow/plan.json section-6/starter/evals/suite.json section-6/starter/run-card.json
```

Your exact wording can differ. The validator checks the engineering boundary,
not one magic sentence.

### Optional recovery copy

Try the repair before using this step. If you need a reviewed recovery copy,
save or commit your current work first.

```bash
git fetch origin section6-harness-evals-candidate
```

[ sample output ]

```text
From https://github.com/schoolofdevops/309-agentic-iac-labs
 * branch            section6-harness-evals-candidate -> FETCH_HEAD
```

Restore only the three learner-owned files from the pinned candidate.

```bash
git restore --source=d5cf5251402751f5306926a8d54f2d21066559fe -- section-6/starter/workflow/plan.json section-6/starter/evals/suite.json section-6/starter/run-card.json
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
```

This command copies reviewed course artifacts. It does not run a model, replace
the harness, or change the fixture.

## PART VI - Build the Accepted Run

### Create the accepted run directory

```bash
mkdir /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
```

### Run the repaired workflow

```bash
node section-6/starter/harness/run-workflow.mjs --engine terraform --output /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Workflow run: FUNCTIONAL PASS
Engine: terraform
Changed files: main.tf
Commands: 3
Context estimate: 90 tokens
Output estimate: 30 tokens
```

### Evaluate all four gates

```bash
node section-6/starter/harness/evaluate-run.mjs --run /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted --suite starter/evals/suite.json
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Run evaluation: PASS (4/4 enabled gates passed)
```

### Read the accepted Run Card

```bash
sed -n '1,320p' /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted/run-card.json
```

The decision is `ready_for_human_review`, not `approved_for_deployment`. One
file changed, three commands ran, no retry occurred, and every gate passed.

### Compare the two runs

```bash
node section-6/scripts/compare-runs.mjs /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted
```

[ sample output ]

```text
Metric            Baseline                       Candidate
Decision          rejected                       ready_for_human_review
Passed gates      2                              4
Changed files     main.tf, notes/team-ownership.md  main.tf
Commands          12                             3
Context estimate  416                            90
Failure classes   safety, budget                 none
```

The better run is not accepted because it is cheaper. It is accepted because it
preserves the functional and regression result while also passing safety and
budget.

### Check the OpenTofu path

The named checker creates and removes its own temporary run.

```bash
node section-6/scripts/check-harness.mjs tofu
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Workflow run: FUNCTIONAL PASS
Engine: tofu
Changed files: main.tf
Commands: 3
Context estimate: 90 tokens
Output estimate: 29 tokens
Run evaluation: PASS (4/4 enabled gates passed)
```

Terraform and OpenTofu validate the same provider-free workflow here. This does
not prove provider lock-file, plan, state, or apply compatibility.

## PART VII - Optional RTK Output Comparison

RTK is optional. The lab does not require it. If Rust Token Killer is installed,
confirm the correct command before using it.

```bash
rtk --version
```

```bash
rtk gain
```

```bash
which rtk
```

Run the same passing check through the proxy.

```bash
rtk proxy node section-6/scripts/check-harness.mjs terraform
```

Then inspect the recorded savings again.

```bash
rtk gain
```

RTK changes how terminal evidence is presented to an agent. It does not change
the raw command records created by the harness, the four gate results, or the
human approval boundary. If RTK is not installed, skip this part.

## Checkpoint

Your Section 6 checkpoint contains:

- a declarative workflow plan with one bounded repair;
- a four-gate evaluation suite;
- a rejected baseline Run Card;
- an accepted candidate Run Card;
- derived changed-file and command evidence;
- clearly labelled token and cost estimates;
- raw local command logs for audit;
- a human approval and Git recovery boundary.

Continue with the Operator Challenge in the Section 6 sidebar.

## Teardown

Use the named cleanup tool for the two Section 6 temporary runs. It refuses
unmarked paths, paths outside temporary roots, symbolic links, and directories
without a valid Section 6 run record.

```bash
node section-6/scripts/cleanup-run.mjs /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Removed Section 6 run: /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-baseline
```

```bash
node section-6/scripts/cleanup-run.mjs /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted
```

[ Expected output ]

```text
Removed Section 6 run: /tmp/agentic-iac-section-6-accepted
```

Your three learner-owned JSON files remain in the labs repository as the course
checkpoint. No Terraform/OpenTofu process or background service remains.
