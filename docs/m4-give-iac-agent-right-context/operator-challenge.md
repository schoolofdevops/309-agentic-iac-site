# Operator Challenge: Resolve a Context Conflict

An IaC coding agent is preparing the asynchronous queue change. Three records
make different claims about the design.

| Source | Trust and freshness | Claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SRC-POLICY-2026-08` | Direct current policy | Test and production must use separate Terraform state and resource boundaries. |
| `SRC-ADR-0002` | Superseded architecture record | Test and production may share Terraform state. |
| `OBS-VALIDATION-2026-08-26` | Direct current validation observation | The current design passed the ownership validator and CALM schema validation. |

## Your task

Write a short conflict record for a reviewer. Include all four parts:

1. **Winning source** — name the source that controls the state decision and
   explain why.
2. **Rejected claim** — identify the claim that must not enter implementation
   context.
3. **Correction path** — explain how the wiki, evidence graph, retrieval pack,
   and append-only log should record the correction.
4. **Evidence limit** — state what the current validation observation proves
   and what it does not prove.

Do not delete the ADR. Keep it as superseded history so a reviewer can see why
the decision changed.

## Review questions

- Does a newer timestamp always make a source more authoritative?
- Can a current validation result override current policy?
- Does a passing schema check prove separate state at runtime?
- Which graph relationship records the rejected claim without treating it as
  current direction?
- What human decision is still required before implementation begins?

## Acceptance criteria

Your conflict record is complete when it:

- selects one winning source and gives an authority reason;
- rejects shared state without deleting its history;
- names a correction in all four compiled artifacts;
- distinguishes design validation from implementation and runtime proof;
- keeps human approval pending;
- creates no infrastructure code and runs no apply or deployment command.

## Review rubric

| Dimension | Strong answer |
| --- | --- |
| Authority | Selects the controlling source because of its role and scope, not timestamp alone. |
| Rejected history | Preserves the stale decision while clearly rejecting its claim. |
| Correction path | Updates the wiki, graph, pack, and append-only log consistently. |
| Evidence boundary | States exactly what validation proves and does not prove. |
| Safety | Keeps implementation and human approval outside the challenge. |

## Checkpoint

Give your record to another learner or reviewer. Ask them to identify one place
where your reasoning depends on authority and one place where it depends on
freshness.

The answer key remains outside the learner site. Defend your source decision
before comparing it with the reference reasoning in the labs repository.
